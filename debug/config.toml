# that has been prepared in advance by an administrator. In order for
# the FIRST administrator to make THEIR account, they must provide the
# token that is specified here. The user that registers with this token
# will have special root privileges, such as creating registration tokens
# that will allow new ADMINS to register.

# When registering using this token, the system will first check if there
# is an existing root account. If there is, the registration attempt will
# be rejected. Otherwise, the account will be created with the root rank.
